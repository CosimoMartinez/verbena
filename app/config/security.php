     * X-Frame-Options:                     setting this option, tells the browser that do not allows 
     *                                      the other sites to display your page inside an iframe.
     *                                      This is a protection against the Clickjacking attacks.
     *                                      Set to 'false' to disable in http response, or specific

     * X-Powered-By:                        disable or enable the X-Powered-By in header response,
     *                                      this is useful to prevent gathering information about
     *                                      current php version.
     *                                      Set to 'false' to disable in http reponse.
     * Content-Security-Policy:             (CSP) with this, you can specify from which locations 
     *                                      you accept javascript, which sites are allowed to 
     *                                      show your page inside an iframe and many other things.
     *                                      If a browser supports CSP, this can be an effective 
     *                                      protection against Cross-Site-Scripting.
     * HTTP Strict-Transport-Security:      (HSTS) with this, the first time a user visits your 
     *                                      site, the browser will store this header. If the user
     *                                      later visits your site again, maybe using an unsafe
     *                                      WLAN connection, the browser remembers to call it
     *                                      exclusively with HTTPS. This would then protect from 
     *                                      SSL-strip.
     * Access-Control-Allow-Origin          The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicates 
     *                                      whether a resource can be shared based by returning 
     *                                      the value of the Origin request header, "*", or "null" 
     *                                      in the response.

     *                                      the omit credentials flag is unset. When part of the 
     *                                      responseto a preflight request it indicates that the 
     *                                      actual request can include user credentials.
     * Access-Control-Expose-Headers:       The Access-Control-Expose-Headers header indicates 
     *                                      which headers are safe to expose to the API of a CORS 
     *                                      API specification.
     * Access-Control-Max-Age:              The Access-Control-Max-Age header indicates how long 
     *                                      the results of a preflight request can be cached in a 
     *                                      preflight result cache.
     * Access-Control-Allow-Methods:        The Access-Control-Allow-Methods header indicates, as 
     *                                      part of the response to a preflight request, which 
     *                                      methods can be used during the actual request.
     * Access-Control-Allow-Headers:        The Access-Control-Allow-Headers header indicates, as 
     *                                      part of the response to a preflight request, which 
     *                                      header field names can be used during the actual request.
